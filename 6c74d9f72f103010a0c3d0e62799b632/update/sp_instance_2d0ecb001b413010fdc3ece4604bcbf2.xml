Airlines advise you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping other people. The same idea goes for self-care - you need to look after yourself first, in order to be there for other people.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Self-care suggestions</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eat a healthy diet - watch out for overeating and overdrinking, which are common coping mechanisms in times of stress</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Get as much fresh air and daylight as possible.

Creating a new routine can bring the structure back into your life. It also breaks up your time and prevents the days from blending into each other. Try to get up at the usual time, get dressed as you normally would, and stick to regular mealtimes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also important to recognize that in a time of crisis, you are unlikely to fulfill all your roles and responsibilities in the way you normally would. For example, you may now find yourself parenting and working simultaneously. Prioritizing your time will ensure that you make time for the important things while being realistic about what you can achieve.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your Environment</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2EYevgdH1AlWQGpRRHPWRBKtwUUjMvtrUlD0Cb61W06UYNQWyZv9wY65lD08V_CgTJmPH19nSfZtpA5hiC21mgyALJsOxohEx_ZyBfsAZeNDsIR6D5gV5RqivhaUohZJFbs4EWU\" alt=\"your environment\" width=\"750\" height=\"499\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">You are more than likely spending a lot of time at home at the moment, so it is worth making your environment as comfortable as possible. Think about how you can make it a more pleasant place to be &ndash; can you clean or declutter your space, or decorate it with photos or pictures? What about the smells and sounds in your environment, how could you improve these?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is particularly important if you are isolating yourself and are confined to just one room. If possible, assign different activities to different areas in your room &ndash; one corner for working, another for relaxing, listening to music or reading.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your Outlook</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/M7AODHuRQdRZogPhUjV_w6IOFnTy8XYZdY472w-xWanLjSJBgr9nhH3ll_7_2tQ0XAtyERxacmzcqMy-3xiVg5t8A9rQQ5DAIFpCAox1cdDPyb_j2zscK4-3cqj55U3k4MxVU9U\" alt=\"outlook covid\" width=\"683\" height=\"455\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maintaining a hopeful outlook in times of fear can be difficult. You might think that the future is bleak, or that being hopeful means you are ignoring the reality of the situation. But having hope is not the same as being optimistic about everything.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best type of optimism is one that is balanced and realistic. Balanced optimism means you can hope for the best while being prepared for the worst.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are finding it difficult to feel hopeful about the future, consider the silver linings in this situation. Ask yourself - what is good about what is happening? What are the opportunities here? Perhaps it has allowed you to slow down, spend more time with family or learn and do new things.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Keep an eye on your mental health</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">During these challenging times, we need to keep an eye on our mental health and look out for those closest to us. There is no doubt that this is a tough situation, and it&rsquo;s understandable that you might be feeling low or missing your loved ones. Reaching out and supporting each other is the best way for us to get through this. Remind yourself that this situation will not last forever and that although you may feel lonely, you are not alone. We are all in this together.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
